# Bone and Spine Oncology

Bone cancer can occur in any part of the body but the most common regions include the spine and pelvis. Most often the tumors are benign (non-aggressive), but the possibility of a non-cancerous tumor cannot be ignored. Spinal/ bone cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the spinal cord or the bones.

## Symptoms of bone cancer:

Upon understanding your condition Dr. Vignesh Puspharaj will suggest a line of treatment that will benefit you the best. Treatment options vary based on the place of the cancer and how far it has spread. Surgery, Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy are the usual options for treatment. They can be used individually or in combination to remove/destroy cancerous tissue and to stabilize the spine.
